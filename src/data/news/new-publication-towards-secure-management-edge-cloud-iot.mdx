üöÄ Excited to share that our work on Policy-as-Code for secure management of edge-cloud microservices has been accepted at the European Conference on Software Architecture 2024 (ECSA2024 - Core A)!

Our work presents an architectural framework and a prototype for integrating and enforcing granular security policies during placement, scaling, migration, and dynamic composition of IoT microservices.

We bring our proposed framework to life with a prototype built using cutting-edge cloud-native technologies like [#Docker](https://x.com/hashtag/Docker?src=hashtag_click), [#Kubernetes](https://x.com/hashtag/Kubernetes?src=hashtag_click), [#Istio](https://x.com/hashtag/Istio?src=hashtag_click), and [#OpenPolicyAgent](https://x.com/hashtag/OpenPolicyAgent?src=hashtag_click).
